title: The Need
---

<p>The need and urgency for the development of the next generation’s engineering global competency has been clearly underscored by Patricia Galloway, former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, in her book, <em>The 21st-Century Engineer, A Proposal for Engineering Reform</em>, <a href="#citation1">[1]</a> where she writes,</p>

<p id="quote"><em>A solid understanding of globalization is key to an engineer’s success in today’s global society. Globalization involves the ability to understand that the world economy has become tightly linked with much of the change triggered by technology; to understand other cultures, especially the societal elements of these cultures; to work effectively in multinational teams; to communicate effectively—both orally and in writing—in the international business language of English; to recognize and understand issues of sustainability; to understand the importance of transparency while working with local populations; and to understand public policy issues around the world and in the country in which one is working. It will be these fundamental capacities that will enable 21st-century engineers to develop into professionals capable of working successfully both domestically and globally, highly respected by the general public...</em></p>

<p>It is with the realization of this need and urgency, particularly as it applies to engineering education, that the GTEC has developed its approach and strategy for the development of the 21st century engineering workforce.</p>

<p>The uniqueness and the strength of the GTEC approach to the development of the next century’s global engineer lie in the choice of the population it works with. Multiple studies have shown that the cultural differences begin developing in the early childhood and continue cultivating over years. As such, the GTEC involves students as early as K-12 school years in authentic international engineering learning experiences with continued fostering of students’ development through higher education (@ GTEC copyright 2010)</p>

<p>The GTEC’s global diversity and engineering curriculum and the innovative pedagogies supported by the unique mentorship structure (by professional engineers and college students) will lead to a generation of engineers with an in-depth, coherent global diversity education and practical training on international engineering projects. By designing, implementing, and evaluating a program for international engineering teams working on common design projects that are supported by in-depth global diversity instructions, we allow students to experience authentic engineering practice while also supplying them with tools, skills, and knowledge to do so. </p>

<p>Moreover, a rigorous study of the effects the diversity training may have on the cross-cultural student team performance may allow for further development and refinement of the program, as well as offer solutions for scaling up the program to serve larger numbers of middle, high and college students on track to engineering profession. Furthermore, this research may provide insight and recommendations for local and international corporations as they tackle the issues of global diversity training for their engineering, management and R&D workforce.</p>
