<h3 class="block">Advisors</h3>


<div class="block">
<img class="intext l" src="/images/team20.jpg" alt="Dr. Charlie Pellerin" />
<p><strong>Dr. Charlie Pellerin</strong> led NASA's astrophysics program worth over $8B for a decade, launching 12 satellites. In 1990, the world discovered that NASA's crown jewel, the Hubble Space Telescope was useless because of a flawed mirror – jeopardising the USD $1.7 Billion program. Charlie mounted the space repair mission that fixed the telescope and NASA awarded him a second Outstanding Leadership Medal. He was curious however about leadership's role in Hubble's mishap. Post-NASA, Charlie joined the University of Colorado teaching 21st century leadership. Inspired by the difference he'd made in his classes the CEOs of Pepsi, Exabyte, and the Area Managing Partner for Ernst & Young asked him to “bring his class into their companies”. Charlie founded 4-D Systems to help clients build high performance leaders and teams. NASA engaged 4-D Systems in 2003 to help with team performance and risks. Charlie's team made a remarkable discovery – the 15 min team development assessments boosted team performance 5% each time! Charlie shared this finding by writing the best selling How NASA Builds Teams (Wiley, 2009). As a result of this work his 4-D coaches won the International Coach Federation's 2007 Prism Award for “enhanced excellence and business achievement with documented return on investment.”</p>

<img class="intext l" src="/images/team16.jpg" alt="Marie Gleason-Tada" />

<p><strong>Marie Gleason-Tada</strong>: spending over 30 years working in education systems in both the U.S. and abroad has given Marie Gleason-Tada a broad understanding of the global aspect of education. And her focus on technology and how it can augment lessons in the classroom allows her to work with all subject areas and grade levels. As a 2011-2012 Einstein Fellow, Gleason-Tada has brought her unique insight to NASA. 
She has an extensive experience as an educator in both the United States and overseas. Marie taught at nearly all grade levels as a classroom teacher at international schools in Japan that incorporated elements of both the American and British educational systems. When computers made their debut in the schools in the 1980s, she pursued an advanced degree in instructional technology and moved from classroom teaching to establishing programs for technology integration in the K-12 curriculum. Since returning from Japan in 1996, Marie has pursued that role in the Chelmsford, Mass., public schools. As a technology integration specialist, she has the opportunity to work with teachers in all subject areas as they plan for ways to use technology in their lessons.</p>

<img class="intext l" src="/images/team23.jpg" alt="Amanda Nelson" />

<p><strong>Amanda Nelson</strong>, GTEC Parent's Committee. Simmons College, MLS, a school librarian, Worcester, MA; Her son, Walter Nelson has participated in the GTEC program for the past 3 years.</p>
<p>"The pathway to a better life is education. Most parents care about their children’s education and hope that their schools are meeting their needs. They also realize that the world is a different place compared to when they were students. Computer technology has had a tremendous impact on society in education, business, communication and even our personal lives. This impact translates into needing additional skills for a competitive world job market.</p>
<p>There’s more to school than just learning facts these days. The future design of educational environments is digital in nature and global in scope. Students spend hours using electronic devices each day, both at home and at school. Therefore, information literacy is paramount for success in today’s world and should be a mandatory addition to curriculum. Critical, analytical, and independent thinking are crucial skills more than ever today for students to acquire as they head into a global environment. Recent data shows that many students who are leaving school at all levelslack any specific practical experience; lack any specific career training; lack a sense of ethical and professional conduct; and lack the ability to communicate effectively in both oral and written form.</p>
<p>GTEC (Global, Technology and Engineering Consortium) is a very unique, innovative program that is essentially designed to meet the needs of a 21stcentury learner and to fill in the gaps where traditional classrooms are failing. Mastering skills that are imperative to survive in the competitive nature of today’s global workforce is at the crux.  With GTEC, students are given the opportunity to create, collaborate and communicate across media-rich networks and systems. The learning is student-centered; they lead with their own initiatives and entrepreneurships skills. They are ultimately responsible for accessing and analyzing information. It also allows their curiosity and imagination to lead the way.</p>
<p>GTEC fuses learning with work and recreation. The learning is not boring or unexciting.  The interactivity and connectivity are qualities that make the learning interesting and meaningful. Students learn how to innovate by setting goals and using talents and creativity to follow their interests.  GTEC’s collaborative slant also prepares students for the actualities of their future work environment. It is a vital link between realistic preparation and the national STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) initiative which has been in the news so much recently."</p>
