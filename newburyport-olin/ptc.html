  <h2>Newburyport High School, Olin College & PTC Pilot Program</h2>
  <h4><em>Sustainability Through Energy Reclamation</em></h4>

  <p>In their Spring 2011 Pilot Program, Olin and Newburyport students have chosen to design a product that reclaims wasted energy. With Olin students acting as mentors and guides, the Newburyport students will process through the entire design process—from initial ideation to a final presentation at Olin’s Spring Expo.</p>

  <p>Newburyport High School is committed to encouraging students in the pursuit of careers in the engineering fields. We send 10-20 of our graduating students to engineering colleges and universities each year with many going on to significant engineering careers. At NHS we like to say that "We are quietly making a difference".</p>

  <p>Olin College, in Needham, MA, was founded to create a new paradigm of engineering education. The college consists of approximately 320 undergraduate engineering students, and graduated its first class in 2006.</p>
