  <h4><em>Fidgeting Students</em></h4>
  
  <p>Team Fidgeting Students wanted to harvest wasted energy by designing a device to charge a battery pack from the motions of a person fidgeting in an office chair. They soon narrowed this down to using rotation of the chair pole to power a generator. The team's final deliverable was this CAD model of a mounting base for the motor-not shown is the Textrix gear mounted to the chair pole shaft.</p>

  <strong>Ideation Sketches</strong>
  <p>Before choosing a project, students brainstormed and sketched many possible ideas. Sketching an idea helps students to identify the essence of the idea, and also to communicate the idea quickly to other team members. To the right is the initial sketch the Fidgeting Students project was based on.</p>

  <strong>Initial CAD</strong>
  <p>The student's first CAD model of the gears and motors on the pole shaft. The design changed significantly between this first version and the final product!</p>

  <strong>Redesign</strong>
  <p>Meeting frequently with their Olin advisors over Skype, the team went through several rounds of redesign. Along the way, they addressed questions such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How do people interact with it?</li>
    <li>How are pieces connected/fastened?</li>
    <li>What happens when the chair moves up and down?</li>
    <li>Does the device need to be built into the chair, or can it be added retroactively?</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Quantitative Analysis</strong>
  <p>As part of the redesign process, students calculated the energy they expected their system to generate. For most students, this involved a quick crash course in physics, so understanding the calculations was no small undertaking.</p>

  <strong>Prototyping</strong>
  <p>As the project neared completion, Olin and Newburyport students met in person to make some final design decisions. They mocked up some elements of the final system with legos, a dismantled chair, Tetrix gears and the motor.</p>

  <strong>Presentation</strong>
  <p>No design project is complete without communicating the results to an outside audience. Team Fidgeting Students documented their project in a poster and presented at the Olin Expo on May 9th, 2011. It was a great project!</p>
