  <h4><em>Kinetic Sculpture</em></h4>
  
  <p>Team Kinetic Sculpture wanted to design a sculpture that would move under the power of wind, harvesting  energy in the process. Here is the final CAD model of their design, in which they chose the "eggbeater" shape to harness the energy in the wind and to give the structure a more appealing look. A handle was added in order to give users of the sculpture an opportunity to add in their own energy.</p>

  <strong>Ideation Sketches</strong>
  <p>Students brainstormed project ideas before before choosing one to work on. Here is an early CAD of the sketch that the team chose. The project started out as a simple wind turbine but quickly turned into a much more involved project. Ideation sketches are important for this reason- they give a foundation to build off of for the rest of the project as well as make it easier to communicate about what the project actually is.</p>

  <strong>Initial CAD</strong>
  <p>The initial CAD of the sculpture: two blades at the top would spin under the wind, turning a gear that is attached to a motor (motor not shown).</p>
  
  <strong>Quantitative Analysis</strong>
  <p>An important part of the redesign process is to quantitatively evaluate the design for the goals of the project. By looking at the physics of a design you can better understand how to improve the design in future versions. For many students, this was the first time being introduced to these concepts, so it was no easy task.</p>

  <strong>Redesign</strong>
  <p>Redesign became an important aspect of the team's progress in designing their kinetic sculpture. Through Skype the team met with their mentors and discussed questions such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What factors influence how much energy is harnessed from the wind?</li>
    <li>How could those factors be changed to maximize the energy harvested?</li>

    <li>How do you deal with too much wind?</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Prototyping</strong>
  <p>One of the final goals for the students was to make a physical prototype of their project. The students printed out their CAD models using a 3D printer and assembled the plastic parts along with purchased ball bearings.</p>
  
  <strong>Presentation</strong>
  <p>After completing their prototype, Team Kinetic Sculpture prepared a presentation and poster and shared their project at the Olin Expo, May 9th, 2011.</p>
