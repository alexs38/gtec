<h1 class="heading">What is GTEC?</h1>
<h5 class="heading">... K12 education, colleges and corporations united to improve engineering education</h5>

<p>Welcome from the Executive Director and Founder, GTEC</p>

<p>The Global Technology and Engineering Consortium (GTEC) brings together educators, students and corporate partners to promote science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) educational initiatives that prepare students with the skills to succeed in diverse, international, team-based contexts.</p>

<p>On behalf of our great team, I am happy to welcome you to the Global Technology and Engineering Consortium (GTEC)! Established in 2010, GTEC is finishing its first academic year and celebrating the first anniversary in July 2011! GTEC is generously hosted by Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, located in the town of Needham, in the greater Boston,  MA area. Our very special thanks to the President of the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, Dr. Richard Miller for his strong support for GTEC! As a true global leader in engineering educations and 
supporter of innovative initiatives, President Miller recognizes the importance of global STEM education and global partnerships in STEM and provides GTEC with its first “home.”</p>

<p>As we all know, there is an exponentially growing concern about the capacity of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) programs to produce a well-prepared workforce in the future.  We live in a very exciting time and our world is changing rapidly. All our graduates will live and work in a global environment we can only imagine. STEM-professionals for the 21st century require a broad multidisciplinary base of knowledge.  They also need more refined and diverse interpersonal skills, leadership, language, intercultural communication and global team work skills as well as deep and broad  knowledge of global diversity and inclusiveness in STEM.</p>

<p>All major universities, many innovative K-12 schools and all major STEM corporations are in a process of broadening global opportunities and significantly expanding their network of STEM education through partnerships with STEM programs around the world. There is an open invitation for the global community in academia, STEM corporations, government and professional associations to join them and to promote Global STEM collaboration;  GTEC is our response to the invitation.</p>

<p>Our very special thanks to our partners – Parametric Technology Corporation, Global Education team (Dima Orlov and Ayora Berry in the US and Tim Brotherhood in the UK), our global diversity guru, Tatyana Fertelmeyster from Connecting Differences, Dr. Russell Faux of Davis Square Research Associates, Alan November, CEO of November Learning, Charles Fadel of the CISCO Corporation, and our dear colleagues and partners in the UK – Sue Kuzubazoglu, Global STEM Education Consultant, Steve Fergusson and Martin Emanuel and all the faculty from Haywood Engineering School in Stoke on Trent.</p>

<p>And, of course, none of this could have happened without the outstanding efforts and hard work of Professor Yevgeniya (Zhenya) V. Zastavker and her students from Olin College of Engineering, Steve Smith and Sarah Leadbeater and their students from Newburyport High School as well as their Superintendent, Dr. Marc Kerble and Principal, Michael Parent; Dr. Julia Sigalovsky and her faculty and students from the Spirit of Knowledge Public Charter School (SOKCS); and Dr. Isa Zimmerman and Annamaria Schrimpf – our gurus in K-12 US education!</p>

<p>Once again, welcome to Global Technology and Engineering Consortium (GTEC)!  We hope our vision inspires you as much as it does us! We would like to hear from you. We invite you to join us on our journey!</p>
