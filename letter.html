<p>On behalf of our great team, I am happy to welcome you to the Global Technology and Engineering Consortium (GTEC)! Established in 2009-2010, GTEC, our team has successfully completed three academic years and will celebrate our 4th anniversary in July 2013! Together with our colleagues and students around the world, we are looking forward to expanding our partnerships & programs! GTEC is generously hosted by Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, located in the town of Needham, in the greater Boston, MA area. Our very special thanks to the President of the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, Dr. Richard Miller for his strong support for GTEC! As a true global leader in engineering educations and supporter of innovative initiatives, President Miller recognizes the importance of global STEM education and global partnerships in STEM and provides GTEC with its first “home.”</p>

<p>As we all know, there is an exponentially growing concern about the capacity of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) programs to produce a well-prepared workforce in the future. We live in a very exciting time and our world is changing rapidly. All our graduates will live and work in a global environment we can only imagine. STEM-professionals for the 21st century require a broad multidisciplinary base of knowledge. They also need more refined and diverse interpersonal skills, leadership, language, intercultural communication and global team work skills as well as deep and broad knowledge of global diversity and inclusiveness in STEM.</p>

<p>All major universities, many innovative K-12 schools and all major STEM corporations are in a process of broadening global opportunities and significantly expanding their network of STEM education through partnerships with STEM programs around the world. There is an open invitation for the global community in academia, STEM corporations, government and professional associations to join them and to promote Global STEM collaboration; GTEC is our response to the invitation.</p>

Together with our colleagues and students around the world, we are looking forward to expanding our partnerships & programs! We hope our vision inspires you as much as it does us! We would like to hear from you. We invite you to join us on our journey!</p>
